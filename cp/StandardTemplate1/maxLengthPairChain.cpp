/*
You are given ‘N’ pairs of integers in which the first number is always smaller than the second number i.e in pair (a,b) -> a < b always. Now we define a pair chain as the continuous arrangement of pairs in which a pair (c,d) can follow another pair (a,b) only when b < c.
Find the length of the longest pair chain that can be formed using the given pairs.
Example:
Given Pairs =  [3,4], [1,2], [2,3].

The length of the maximum chain will be 2. The longest chain is [1,2] -> [3,4].
Note:
1. You can select a pair only once.

2. You needn’t use up all the given pairs.

3. You can select pairs in any order.
Input Format:
The first line of the input contains an integer ‘T’ denoting the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single positive integer ‘N’ denoting the total number of the pairs.

Next ‘N’ lines of each test case contain two space-separated integers ‘a’ and ‘b’ denoting the elements of the pair.
Output Format:
For each test case, return a positive integer denoting the maximum length of the pair chain that can be possible while satisfying the given condition.

The output of each test case will be printed in a separate line.
Note:
You don’t need to print anything, it has been already taken care of. Just implement the given function.
Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 10^4
-10^9 <= a,b <= 10^9

Where ‘a’ and ‘b’ is the elements of the pair.

Time Limit: 1 sec
Sample Input 1:
2
3
5 8
3 4
3 4
2
2 3
-1 2
Sample Output 1:
2
1
Explanation for Sample Output 1:
In test case 1, The max length pair chain will be [3,4], -> [5,8] as 4 < 5 that means we can join these two pairs and form a chain of length two.

In test case 2, To join two pairs (a,b), (c,d) we need b < c but this condition is not satisfied by the given pairs in the input hence the max length will be 1 and the max length pair chain will be [2,3] or [-1,2].
Sample Input 2:
2
1
10 20
4
4 6
2 3
9 12
15 20
Sample Output 2:
1
4
